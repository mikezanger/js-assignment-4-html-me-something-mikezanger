                  <img src = "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyMzE1MDU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY3MjUzNA@@._V1_.jpg" alt = "Let the Right One In poster." height = "700" width = "490">
                  <p>"Coming in at number 7 on my list is the 2008 Swedish vampire film, directed by Tomas Alfredson, Let the Right One In. 
                     Based on the 2004 novel written by John Ajvide Linquist, Let the Right One In is the story of a 12 year old boy, Oskar, living in a Stockholm suburb.
                     Oskar is a sweet kid, but a little awkward and without friends. He is viciously bullied and tormented by his evil classmates, making him even more withdrawn and sad.
                     The movie makes you feel awful for poor Oskar and wish that there was someone out there to be his friend and teach the bullies a lesson. 
                     Thankfully, that is when Oskar meets Eli. Eli is a very pale girl who appears to be around the same age as Oskar and only goes outside at night. Spoiler alert: shes a vampire.
                     I dont want to give too much of the movie away, but I will say that Oskar's bullies learn not to pick on people anymore."</p>

                  <p>"Made on a tiny budget by a bunch of friends in a little cabin in the woods, Evil Dead 2 spawned a huge franchise with millions of obsessed fans all over the world.
                      Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Bruce Campbell as Ash, Evil Dead 2 combined a comedic tone with gruesome horror as well as anyone had before or since.
                      A group of friends head to a creepy cabin in the middle of nowhere for a weekend of fun and partying. The party doesn't last long though. 
                      After finding and reading from an ancient book they accidentally release an evil spirit that possesses them one by one, turning them into demons.
                      Ash has to survive the night by fighting off his possessed friends, using whatever weapons he can find. Including one of films most famous weapons, the chainsaw hand.

                  <p>"The sequel to to the Ridley Scott classic, Alien, Aliens picks up decades after the end of the first film. Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver, entered a hypersleep at the end of the first film and then drifted out into space.
                      Decades later her spaceship is recovered and she is awakened from her sleep. After finding out she has been asleep for years and everyone she knew was long dead she tells her rescuers what happened to land her in this situation
                      After learning about the killer alien that wiped out Ripley's shipmates, some very powerful people decide they want to capture them and use them as weapons. 
                      Of course this plan works out about as well as you'd expeect. Leading a team of space marines, Ripley heads to the planet where the alien came from. Things go bad quick and Ripley is once again in a fight for her life.
                      This James Cameron directed film is one of the few sequels that manage to live up to(and in my opinion surpass) the original"

                  <p>"Maybe the most 1980s film ever made, Joel Schumacher's The Lost Boys, is a cheesy blast. Big hairdos, teenage vampire gangs, and an incredibly ripped dude playing a saxophone are just some of the reasons this is a must see.
                      When brothers Michael and Sam move to the fictional beach town Santa Clara, California, they waste no time making new friends. Older brother Michael falls in with a group of motorcycle riding hoodlums(who are also vampires) and younger brother Sam with two comicbook store worker(who are also vampire hunters).
                      After a night of partying and riding bikes, Michaels new friends decide to initiate him into their gang by turning him into a vampire. When Sam starts to notice his older brother exhibiting strange behavior, such as avoiding sunlight and floating, he realizes his brother has become a creature of the night.
                      His vampire hunting friends, the Frog Brothers, inform him that the only way to save his brother is to find the head vampire responsible and kill him. That is of course easier said than done."

                  <p class="funParagraph" id="testPs">"When a special forces team led by Arnold Scwarzenegger end up in a South American Jungle, they stumble upon something even more dangerous than themselves. After finding the bodies of a paramilitary group hanging from trees a hundred feet off the ground they quickly realize something strange is going on.
                      Whoever or whatever could take out an armed militia that easily was not included in their mission briefing. It doesn't take long to find out who is responsible. Something in the jungle sets its sights on Arnold's heavily armored crew and begins picking them off with ease.
                      An alien has landed on earth to hunt the most formidable prey he can find, kill them, and take their skulls as trophys. With his super strength, cloaking ability and advanced alien weaponry, even the strongest humans stand no chance against The Predator. 
                      Except for Arnold Schwarzenegger of course."

                  <p>"When one of the greatest directors of all time uses material from one of the greatest horror writers of all time, you get a classic film like The Shining. Stanley Kubrick's classic film based on the book by Stephen King is not only one of the best horror movies of all time, its one of the best movies of all time.
                      Recovering alcoholic and writer Jack Torrance takes a job as winter caretaker at a secluded hotel in the Rocky Mountains. He brings along his wife and young son and plans to have a great winter writing in a beautiful hotel they have all to themselves. 
                      It turns out they don't have the place all to themselves though. The Overlook Hotel is no normal hotel. They quickly discover that the hotel has a disturbing history of tragedy and deaths, leaving behind dozens of angry spirits who begin to torment the family.
                      Jack, played by Jack Nicholson(in one of the best performances ever) develops a serious case of writers block and begins to slip into madness. After being manipulated by the spirits into drinking again, his madness takes over completely.
                      Jack turns his drunken anger and madness towards his family and starts hunting them down. This leads to one of the most intense final acts in film history"

                  <h2 class="titleColor"> 1. Dawn of the Dead</h2>
                  <img src = "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61XaJr+zjuL._AC_UF894,1000_QL80_.jpg" alt ="Dawn of the Dead poster." height = "700" width = "490">
                  <p style="text-align: center;">"Here we are finally! Not just my favorite horror movie, but my favorite movie of all time. If you actually manage to read all of this I am honored and hope I haven't bored you too much. Dawn of the Dead, what a classic!
                      Before The Walking Dead turned zombies into America's most popular monsters, George Romero was single handidly creating the genre countless others would imitate. Dawn of the Dead is the follow up to another classic Romero film that truly started the genre, Night of the Living Dead.
                      Romero creates a universe where the dead no longer stay that way. Instead they get up and start trying to eat anyone and everyone they can. Society has collapsed and people are doing whatever they can to avoid the zombies and stay alive. The stars of this film have found a shopping mall overrun by zombies and decide to make it their home.
                      After clearing out the mall of zombies they have all the food and supplies they could need and all things considered, manage to create a pretty decent life for themselves. At least for a little while. Of course things begin to fall apart and their little home turns into a nightmare.
                      If you are going to watch one movie off this list, it should be this one. The acting is a little cheesy at times and the special effect makeup looks a little dated, but overall its as good now as it was the day it came out."
